(During this process, I went through a repeated cycle of "attempting" and "failing". But when my imperfect yet practical algorithm was presented, the immense sense of satisfaction came to me, which I will never forget. To this day, I am grateful for this experience and all the members and mentors within the team. A special thank you goes to the team captain. At a low point in my study and life, when the seemingly endless "dirty work" of the previous project made me increasingly anxious and I am unconsciously sensitive to the emotions and voices around me, she pulled me into the competition. Had it not been for her, I might have given up long ago.)
