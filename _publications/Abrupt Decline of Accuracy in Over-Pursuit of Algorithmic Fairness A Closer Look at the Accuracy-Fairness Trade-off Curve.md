### Abstract: 

With the increasing use of machine learning algorithms in high-stakes applications, understanding the trade-off between accuracy and fairness is critical. However, previous works have focused more on demonstrating the existence of this trade-off rather than characterizing its shape. In this paper, we first investigate the ideal scenario in which sensitive attributes are fully redundantly encoded in the data. We find that in most cases, the accuracy-fairness trade-off curve is continuous rather than abrupt. Besides, we decompose unfairness into "self-unfairness" inherent in the data itself, and "classifier unfairness" stemming from the choice of classifier. We prove that achieving absolute fairness is nearly impossible. Moreover, we formally certify the existence of the accuracy-fairness trade-off and show that under certain conditions, accuracy can suffer a sudden decline when over-pursuing fairness. Numerical examples demonstrate how our analysis illuminates the trade-off curve.
