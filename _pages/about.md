I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Industrial Engineering(IE) and minoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am broadly interested in Trustworthy AI, optimization and the application in machine learning, specifically with a specific focus on: 

- Algorithm fairness, esp. with data-centric methods
- Transportation Planning
- Machine learning in quantitative trading.
