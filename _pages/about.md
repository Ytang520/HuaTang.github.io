I'm an undergraduate student (Gap Year) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Industrial Engineering(IE) and minoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I previsouly studied Trustworthy AI (esp. algorithmic fairness), as well as LLM-related researches. I'm open to exploring other research topics.

My CV and transcript can be downloaded through these links ([CV](files/CV_Frank(Hua)_Tang.pdf) and [Transcript](files/Transcript_Hua_Tang.pdf)).

My Academic Statement can be downloaded through this line ([Academic Statement](files/Academic Statement.pdf)) (Last Update: 12/2023. I’ll update it with my recent research and studies later in December 2024.)

My [blog](https://nolebase-template-smoky.vercel.app/) can be found here, where I share some research ideas, intermediate results, notes and so on. Hope that I'll update it everyday. - Edited on 2024/10/21

## Note

I am currently exploring the key factors affecting AI-related Ph.D. admissions, especially given 1. the field's rapid expansion and growing volume of research; 2. the inevitable gap between the academic research and industry needs; 3. the post-pandemic international situation. I expect this research to be both qualitative and quantitative, gathering some insights for understanding the dynamics.

This is a personal exploration, completely driven by curiosity without any funding or public support. If you are AI-related professors/researchers/students, I would be very grateful if you could spare 15~30 minutes for a conversation.

The conversation will be complete confidential. And if you are interested, I would be happy to keep you updated on the progress and findings of the project, which could offer a broader view of current trends in Ph.D. admissions.

Thank you so much for your help!
