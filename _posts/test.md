Statement of Purpose

"Deep learning techniques are merely tools; what topic do you intend to investigate, and more importantly, from what perspective or angle?" In the deep learning class I attended, the professor posed this pivotal question. Building upon my strong foundation in this field throughout my undergraduate and particularly through my research on trustworthy AI under the supervision of Prof. Mengnan Du, I can now provide a clear answer: My focus lies in building efficient and trustworthy machine learning, with an approach centered around specifying and leveraging the properties of the data distribution to align data, model, and tasks. Pursuing a Ph.D. would allow me to delve deeper into my research interests and contribute to this field.

To broaden my understanding of efficient machine learning beyond the classroom, I first studied the high-frequency financial market due to its competitiveness and the need for timely responses to various unexpected challenges. The main challenge was to design effective techniques for high-frequency trading to achieve excess returns. In 2022, I led a team and conducted extensive data preprocessing and extracted multiple financial factors to capture the underlying properties of the data distribution. After n extensive literature review, I proposed an innovative approach utilizing shallow and curated LSTM models, aiming to enhance accuracy while maintaining computation speed. The results were remarkable, surpassing traditional methods by 1.5%—a noteworthy accomplishment, considering the inherent challenges in achieving even a 0.5% improvement over existing methods within the high-frequency trading domain.  Through this process, I refined my research skills and recognized the substantial impact of the hidden structure of observed data on the efficiency, particularly the model performance, of machine learning techniques. Moreover, I realized the critical role of computation speed in efficiency, prompting my future research focus on this aspect.

To explore the factors affecting computation speed, I conducted research on accelerating the computation speed of an existing framework for skeleton-based human motion quality assessment. I carried out this research under the supervision of Prof. Yongxiang Li with the goal of refining the framework based on the spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Network. During literature research, I discovered that existing methods, despite stacking multiple layers of LSTM in the temporal domain and employing a large number of parameters, still struggled to effectively extract temporal symmetries in videos. Consequently, I introduced bilateral LSTM with an attention module to reduce the need for stacking extracted representations while maintaining performance. I also identified inefficiencies, such as code redundancy, in the existing codebase. Therefore, I rewrote the code from scratch and several incorporated acceleration techniques such as matrix acceleration modules. These efforts successfully led to a 25% increase in training efficiency, reducing batch training time from 60 seconds to 45 seconds. To utilize the insights gained from the previous coding, I also participated in several competitions and achieved top ranks among hundreds of teams. In one competition, I designed an innovative Sandwich optimization algorithm to eliminate the negative-weighted Eulerian circuits, which was seldom addressed in the literature. Finally, our team clinched the second prize in this national competition, competing against nearly 200 teams. During this journey, my coding skills witnessed substantial growth and again found that the efficiency, including computation speed, relied heavily on the data hidden structure.

To delve into the realm of trustworthy machine learning and explore the intricacies of data hidden structures, in the summer of 2023, I immersed myself in the study of properties related to trustworthy notions, particularly fairness, under the guidance of Prof. Mengnan Du. To disentangle the data-centric view and model-centric view in measuring unfairness, I decomposed it into data unfairness arising from the data distribution and model unfairness stemming from the choice of models under reasonable assumptions. This approach provided theoretical insights, suggesting that the influence of the hidden structure on the trade-off can be partially captured by the boundaries of each group. Building on these findings, I conducted an extensive analysis of the trade-off between fairness and model performance. Finally, I revealed a potential non-convex nature of the accuracy-fairness Pareto Frontier when excessively pursuing fairness. This discovery contradicted the common assumption of a convex frontier and pushed the boundaries further of theoretical understanding in this domain. I also submitted this work as the first author to ICLR 2024. During this process, I observed that different types of data distributions may exhibit similar behaviors under the same model. This prompted me to investigate the properties of data distributions affecting model performance and understand the underlying mechanisms. Hence, I currently study the hidden structure of data distributions and its impact on the Neural Collapse. Recent empirical analyses suggested that the hidden structure might influence the process or manifestation of Neural Collapse. Therefore, I leverage a specific data distribution property which is the data trend, to examine its impact on model performance. These research experiences are both challenging and intriguing, prompting me to investigated the properties of the real distribution and align data, model, and tasks, which fosters a thoughtful perspective in addressing complex issues on trustworthy AI.

Building upon my previous research experiences, I am determined to pursue a research career in question-guided efficient and trustworthy machine learning, with the ultimate goal of seeking permanent academic positions. Data-centric techniques shed light on the concept of “ideal distributions” on the table, hence providing a specifying and leveraging what the properties of ideal distributions are is imperative to aligning data, model, and tasks for desired outputs. In the future, I plan to examine the hidden structure of data, particularly the relationships between classes like graph relationships, in the context of deep learning methods. I aim to develop new algorithms based on identified patterns to meet diverse objectives. Specifically, I will initiate my exploration from the transitive relation between classes, a relatively straightforward relation, to investigate transitivity within text data types—an aspect not fully captured by the classic topic model. Building on these this, I seek to enhance the robustness and fairness of Large Language Models (LLM).

Pursuing a Ph.D. would allow me to explore my interests at the highest level. If granted this extraordinary opportunity, I aim to leverage the resources within this department, especially the open environment for academic discussion and the potential of collaborating with experts from different domains, to contribute to world-class research and launch a successful research career of my own.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
